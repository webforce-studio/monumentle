## Notes for Organization

To organize these monuments into 5 separate folders (50 monuments each), we'll use the following structure:

1. **monuments-group-1/** (IDs 1-50)
2. **monuments-group-2/** (IDs 51-100)
3. **monuments-group-3/** (IDs 101-150)
4. **monuments-group-4/** (IDs 151-200)
5. **monuments-group-5/** (IDs 201-250+)

This will prevent any single folder from becoming too large while maintaining a logical organization.
