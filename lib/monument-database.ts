    "description": "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower is the tallest structure in Paris and the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct. It was the world's tallest man-made structure from 1889 to 1930, when it was surpassed by the Chrysler Building in New York City.",

Despite its age, it is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus. The Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points of its history over the centuries, having an average audience of some 65,000. It was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock naval battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology.",

Each standing stone is around 13 feet high, seven feet wide, and weighs around 25 tons. The stones are set within earthworks in the middle of the most dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred tumuli. Archaeologists believe it was constructed from 3100 to 2000 BC. The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about 3100 BC. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the first bluestones were raised between 2400 and 2200 BC, although they may have been at the site as early as 3000 BC.",

The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-Gothic style. When completed in 1859, its clock was the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world. The tower stands 316 feet tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. Its base is square, measuring 40 feet on each side.",

The palace was commissioned by Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and in honor of Richard Wagner. Ludwig paid for the palace out of his personal fortune and by means of extensive borrowing, rather than Bavarian public funds. The castle was intended as a personal refuge for the reclusive king, but it was opened to the paying public immediately after his death in 1886. Since then more than 61 million people have visited Neuschwanstein Castle. More than 1.3 million people visit annually, with as many as 6,000 per day in the summer. The palace has appeared prominently in several movies and was the inspiration for Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty Castle and later, similar structures.",

It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece, generally considered the zenith of the Doric order. Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art. The Parthenon is regarded as an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece, democracy and Western civilization, and one of the world's greatest cultural monuments.",

    "description": "Notre-Dame de Paris is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, France. The cathedral, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, is considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. Its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous and colourful rose windows, and the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration set it apart from the earlier Romanesque style. Major components that make Notre-Dame stand out include one of the world's largest organs and its immense church bells. The cathedral was begun in 1163 under Bishop Maurice de Sully and was largely completed by 1260, though it was modified frequently in the following centuries. In the 1790s, Notre-Dame suffered desecration during the French Revolution; much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed.",

Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges currently owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. The bridge consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers.",

    "description": "The Alhambra is a palace and fortress complex located in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. It was originally constructed as a fortress in AD 889 on the remains of Roman fortifications, and then largely ignored until its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Moorish emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its current palace and walls. It was converted into a royal palace in 1333 by Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada. After the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella, and the palaces were partially altered in the Renaissance style. In 1526, Charles I & V commissioned a new Renaissance palace better befitting the Holy Roman Emperor in the revolutionary Mannerist style influenced by Humanist philosophy in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid Andalusian architecture.",

The word acropolis is from the Greek words ἄκρον and πόλις. Although the term acropolis is generic and there are many other acropoleis in Greece, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as 'The Acropolis' without qualification. During ancient times it was known also more properly as Cecropia, after the legendary serpent-man, Cecrops, the supposed first Athenian king. While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium BC, it was Pericles in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the site's most important present remains including the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheium and the Temple of Athena Nike.",

It was the city's tallest building until the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600. The original building, known as Trinity Church and later Trinity Cathedral, contained eight churches arranged around the ninth, central church of Intercession; the tenth church was erected in 1588 over the grave of venerated local saint Vasily (Basil). In the 16th and 17th centuries, the cathedral, perceived (together with the Kremlin) as a symbol of Moscow, was popularly known as Jerusalem.",

Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality.

Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen's House. During the 19th century it was enlarged, principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837. The palace has 775 rooms, including 19 State rooms, 52 Royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms.",

Despite ongoing efforts to stabilize the tower, it continues to lean at a rate of about one millimeter per year. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of Italy's architectural heritage.",

The tomb is the centerpiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal is regarded by many as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements from Persian, Ottoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles.",

She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A broken chain and shackle lie at her feet as she walks forward, commemorating the national abolition of slavery. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States: a welcoming signal to immigrants arriving from abroad. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.",

On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica. Construction commenced in 1882 and Gaudí became involved in 1883, taking over the design and transforming it with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. Gaudí devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the crypt. At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete. Construction is expected to be completed in 2026, a century after Gaudí's death.",

Standing at 102 meters tall the Atomium was envisioned as a symbol of scientific progress and the atomic age. The interconnected spheres house exhibition spaces and public areas and a panoramic viewing platform at the top offers vistas over Brussels. The Atomium is an iconic example of post-war optimism and modernist design and it has become one of Belgium's most recognized symbols as well as a major tourist attraction.",

Notably the Ponte Vecchio has merchant shops built along its span—a tradition dating back to the 13th century—originally butchers and tanners later replaced by jewelers and goldsmiths. Richly associated with Florence's economic and cultural life the bridge survived World War II intact allegedly spared by Hitler's orders.

Revered as the Eighth Wonder of the World their sophisticated engineering relies on a complex irrigation network sourcing water from upland rainforests. The terraces cover about 20000 hectares rising up to 1500 meters above sea level and continue to support local rice and vegetable farming. Their maintenance and continued existence exemplify the Ifugao people's ingenuity community spirit and deep ecological knowledge. Despite UNESCO World Heritage inscription and worldwide acclaim the terraces now face challenges from changing agricultural practices climate and youth migration causing erosion and a decline in active cultivation.",

The façade of the main temple is dominated by four colossal statues of Ramses II each over 20 meters high. In the 1960s both temples were relocated to higher ground to prevent submersion by Lake Nasser following the construction of the Aswan High Dam.

The site inhabited from about 9500 BCE to 8000 BCE offers unique insights into prehistoric religion before the widespread adoption of agriculture. Investigations here have revolutionized understanding of the transition from hunter-gatherer to sedentary societies as there is little evidence of agriculture or permanent settlement at the time.
