# 🍪 Cookie Consent Implementation (GDPR Blocking Version)

This implementation provides a **fully GDPR-compliant, blocking cookie consent** for Next.js and React apps. Users must make a choice before accessing your site. After a choice, no further cookie bar is shown.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install react-cookie-consent lucide-react
```

### 2. Copy Files
- Copy `components/cookie-consent-blocking.tsx` to your project (e.g. `components/`)
- Copy `styles/globals.css` variables to your global CSS
- Copy `google-analytics-setup.tsx` to your layout or `_app.tsx`

### 3. Configure IDs
- Replace `YOUR_GA_ID` with your Google Analytics ID
- Replace `YOUR_ADSENSE_ID` with your AdSense publisher ID (if using AdSense)

## ✨ Features

✅ **GDPR Compliant** - Users must choose before accessing site  
✅ **No persistent cookie bar** after choice  
✅ **Google Analytics & AdSense Integration** - Respects user consent  
✅ **Professional, accessible design**  
✅ **Responsive** - Works on all devices  
✅ **Easy to customize**

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **First Visit**: Full-screen overlay blocks all interaction
2. **User Must Choose**: Cannot access site until consent decision
3. **Accept**: Enables analytics + ads, unlocks site
4. **Decline**: Keeps everything disabled, unlocks site
5. **Subsequent Visits**: No bar, no overlay

## 🛠️ Integration Example (Next.js App Router)

```tsx
import { BlockingCookieConsent } from "@/components/cookie-consent-blocking"
import { GoogleAnalyticsSetup, GoogleAdSenseSetup } from "@/cookie-consent-implementation/google-analytics-setup"

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <GoogleAnalyticsSetup />
        <GoogleAdSenseSetup />
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <BlockingCookieConsent />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

---

## 🧪 Local Development & Testing
- To test the blocking overlay again, clear your browser's localStorage:
  - Open DevTools → Console
  - Run: `localStorage.clear()`
  - Refresh the page
- The overlay will reappear as if you are a new user.

---

## 🔄 Optional: Allow Users to Change Consent Later
If you want users to change their consent after their first choice, add a button or link somewhere on your site that runs:
```js
localStorage.removeItem('flagguesser-cookie-consent');
window.location.reload();
```
This will show the overlay again on next page load.

---

## 📝 Notes
- This setup is **production-ready** and meets strict privacy requirements.
- You can further customize the overlay's text, colors, and logic in `cookie-consent-blocking.tsx`.
- The regular (non-blocking) cookie bar is not shown after a choice for maximum compliance and best UX.
